# README: Detection & Analysis of DoS Attack

## Project Title:
**Detection and Analysis of DoS Attack**

## Abstract:
Denial of Service (DoS) attacks are a major threat to online services, preventing legitimate users from accessing web applications by overwhelming the target with excessive traffic. This project investigates **SYN Flood Attack** and **Ping Flood Attack** and provides a methodology for detecting and analyzing these attacks using **Wireshark** and **Python-based packet analysis**.

## Keywords:
- Wireshark
- Ping Attack
- SYN Flood Attack

## Introduction:
- A **DoS attack** disrupts network or system availability for legitimate users.
- Attackers often use **bandwidth exhaustion** or internal network vulnerabilities to carry out such attacks.
- This project implements and analyzes **two types of DoS attacks**:
  1. **SYN Flood Attack** â€“ Overwhelming a system with incomplete TCP connection requests.
  2. **Ping Flood Attack** â€“ Sending a large number of ICMP (ping) requests to saturate the target's resources.

## Methodology:
1. **Packet Capture with Wireshark:**
   - Record normal network traffic.
   - Execute DoS attacks using **hping3** tool in Kali Linux.
   - Capture traffic again post-attack.

2. **SYN Flood Attack Detection Algorithm:**
   - Compare the number of **SYN** vs. **SYN-ACK** packets before and after the attack.
   - Use **Python & Matplotlib** for graphical analysis.

3. **Ping Flood Attack Detection Algorithm:**
   - Compare the number of **ICMP Echo Requests** before and after the attack.
   - Analyze the results using Python.

## Results & Discussion:
- The number of **TCP SYN packets** increased after the SYN Flood attack.
- The number of **ICMP Echo Requests** increased after the Ping Flood attack.
- Graphical analysis helped visualize the attack patterns.

## Conclusion:
- DoS attacks **do not steal data** but **degrade or block system availability**.
- This project successfully **detected and analyzed SYN Flood and Ping Flood attacks**.
- Various **countermeasures** can be applied, such as:
  - **Using IDS/IPS tools**
  - **Filtering network traffic**
  - **Implementing rate-limiting and load balancers**
  - **Shutting down unnecessary services**

## References:
- Research papers and studies on DoS attack detection and prevention.
- Literature on intrusion detection systems and network security frameworks.
